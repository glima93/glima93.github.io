  abstract: "We leverage within-family-by-year variation to study the effect of cumulative exposure to children with college-educated parents on the school outcomes of children from less educated households. We use administrative data on the universe of public education students in Portugal, a school system with some of the highest rates of grade repetition, and where students who do not have parents with a college degree are six times more likely to repeat a grade than those with college-educated parents. We use family-by-year fixed effects to control for the significant non-random sorting of parents into schools and time-varying shocks to the family environment. We find that higher exposure to students with college-educated parents offers significant protection against grade repetition for children from less educated households. Moving a student from the tenth to the 90th percentile in the distribution of cumulative exposure is equivalent to about a quarter of the gap in grade repetition by parental education. The effect is more pronounced throughout middle school, where we also find that a standard deviation increase in exposure increases GPA by $4$ percent of a standard deviation, and reduces the proportion of failed school subjects by 4.5 percent of a standard deviation. Our findings suggest that policies curtailing segregation across schools based on parental education can play an important role in helping to close large achievement gaps between these groups."

- title: "Grading Leniency and Educational Choices: Evidence from a Blind Grading Regime"

  abstract: "How do positive signals of academic ability change educational choices and future performance? I study the consequences of receiving a higher grade in a national standardized test on students' outcomes. For identification, I exploit the random assignment of graders to anonymized tests in the end of middle school, using administrative data from Portugal. First, I show that there is substantial grade manipulation in this blind grading context, consistent with graders being lenient. I then use bunching methods to identify the plausibly causal effect of leniency on students' choices. I find that low performers who benefit from lenient grading are significantly less likely to repeat the same school grade, and encouraged to enrol in a more demanding high school track. However, I cannot reject that there is no impact on academic achievement in the medium- and long-term. Finally, although graders do not observe test takers characteristics, I show that leniency in grading is selective on characteristics that may be indirectly inferred from the test. In particular, girls are marginally more likely to be bumped up."
