  abstract: "We study the effect of exposure to peers with college-educated parents on the school outcomes of children from less educated households. For identification, we exploit within-family-by-year variation to control for the significant non-random sorting of parents into schools, and time-varying shocks to the family environment. We use rich administrative data from Portugal, a school system with some of the largest gaps in educational attainment by children's socio-economic status among OECD countries. We find that moving a student from the tenth to the 90th percentile in the distribution of exposure to children with college-educated parents is equivalent to about a fifth of the gap in grade repetition by parental education. In middle school, we also find that a standard deviation increase in exposure increases GPA by 2.6 percent of a standard deviation, and reduces the proportion of failed school subjects by 3.4 percent of a standard deviation. Our findings suggest that policies curtailing segregation across schools based on parental education can play an important role in helping to close large achievement gaps between these groups."

- title: "Grading Leniency and Educational Choices: Evidence from a Blind Grading Regime"

  abstract: "How do positive signals of academic ability change educational choices and future performance? I study the consequences of receiving a higher grade in a national standardized test on students' outcomes. For identification, I exploit the random assignment of graders to anonymized tests in the end of middle school, using administrative data from Portugal. First, I show that there is substantial grade manipulation in this blind grading context, consistent with graders being lenient. I then use bunching methods to identify the plausibly causal effect of leniency on students' choices. I find that low performers who benefit from lenient grading are significantly less likely to repeat the same school grade, and encouraged to enrol in a more demanding high school track. However, I cannot reject that there is no impact on academic achievement in the medium- and long-term. Finally, although graders do not observe test takers characteristics, I show that leniency in grading is selective on characteristics that may be indirectly inferred from the test. In particular, girls are marginally more likely to be bumped up."

#  abstract: "Being the youngest in a cohort entails many penalties. Using administrative data of every public-school student in Portugal, we show that although performance gains from being 1-year older fade quickly from primary education to high school, age-related penalties persist through a combination of grade retention, educational tracking and testing policies. Those that start school younger are more likely to repeat grades and ultimately drop out from school. Older entrants are more likely to enroll in scientific curricula in high school, are more successful at accessing public higher education and enroll in more selective undergraduate courses."
